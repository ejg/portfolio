	<p>I graduated from Michigan State University with a degree in Computational Mathematics. I moved to North Carolina to work for IBM &lt;blah blah blah...boring stuff about hardware simulators here&gt; and eventually moved on to a Smalltalk group doing &lt;blah blah blah...boring stuff about router configuration here&gt;. I left for Broadband Technologies where I was the Lead Developer of the Smalltalk User Interface and Gemstone Database code. Now I have found my niche in HTML/CSS moving pixels and creating wonderful websites.</p>
	<p>I am an expert in HTML, CSS, jQuery, and PHP. I am proficient in Javascript and Wordpress. I have worked on small to large websites. I have written content management systems with PHP/mySQL.  I have installed and skinned Wordpress sites. I understand cross-browser compatibility issues and all the trouble IE6 can cause. I write clean, standards-compliant code that is easy to maintain. I am excited about the possiblities that HTML5 and CSS3 (font-face rocks!) are bringing to the web developement world.</p>
	<p>I created my own framework that enables me to rapidly develop websites.  My framework uses the Two-Step View Pattern for the layout.  In this pattern a template file defines the header, navigation, footer, and other common areas of a website. The unique content for each page is then included. .htaccess handles the redirects and makes the urls pretty. Mach 9 used this frame work for all websites that did not use cakePHP, Wordpress, or ExpressionEngine. </p>
	<p>Please view my <a href="resume.html">resume</a> and <a href="portfolio.html">portfolio</a>. My portfolio page shows the websites I have worked on along with the skills I used for each. Links to the live or development site are included.</p>

		<h1>Programming disciplines I am passionate about</h1>
		<ol class="mylist">
			<li>OOP <p>MVC in particular.</p></li>
			<li>Separation of data (database) and framework (html) and presentation (css) and behavior (javascript)<p>And good heavens, don't put your mysql querys in my UI.</p></li>
			<li>Easy to use, consistent and accessible user interfaces</li>
			<li>"Dumb" user interfaces <p>Don't make my UI do things (like sort lists) that are faster in the database.</p></li>
			<li>Writing code the right way instead of the quick way <p>It may take longer in the beginning to factor out a piece of code to be reused but copy and pasting the same piece of code multiple places is a maintanence nightmare.</p></li>
			<li>Semantic html <p>Tables are for tabular data.</p></li>
			<li>Scalability <p>Just because your website works fine with one user logged in doesn't mean it won't choke when 100 are logged in.</p></li>
			<li>Smart SEO <p>Keeping the balance of user experience and SEO can be tricky. Just say No! to keyword stuffing.</p></li>
			<li>Google Map APIs <p>Just becasue they're fun.</p></li>
			<li>Favicons <p>Every website deserves a favicon!</p></li>

		<p>I have written a form module for <a href="http://kohanaphp.com/">Kohana</a> to create form/label pair wrapped in a div. It is lightweight, easy to use and makes creating forms much easier. You can download my PHP code, view the source and see an example <a href="http://cssmysite.com/example_form">here.</a></p>
