	<p>I graduated from Michigan State University with a degree in Computational Mathematics. I moved to North Carolina to work for IBM &lt;blah blah blah...boring stuff about hardware simulators here&gt; and eventually moved on to a Smalltalk group doing &lt;blah blah blah...boring stuff about router configuration here&gt;. I left for Broadband Technologies where I was the Lead Developer of the Smalltalk User Interface and Gemstone Database code. Now I have found my niche in HTML/CSS moving pixels and creating wonderful websites.</p>
	<p>I am an expert in HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, and PHP. I have worked on small to large websites. I have written responsive websites from scratch and converted old static websites to be responsive. I have written learning management systems with PHP/mySQL. I understand cross-browser compatibility issues and all the trouble <strike>IE6</strike> <strike>IE11</strike> Safari can cause. I write clean, standards-compliant code that is easy to maintain.</p>

		<h1>Programming disciplines I am passionate about</h1>
		<ol class="mylist">
			<li>OOP <p>MVC in particular.</p></li>
			<li>Separation of data (database) and framework (html) and presentation (css) and behavior (javascript)<p>And good heavens, don't put your mysql querys in my UI.</p></li>
			<li>Easy to use, consistent and accessible user interfaces</li>
			<li>Accessibility <p>Every website needs a skip link.</p></li>
			<li>Use cases <p>Actually, documentation of any kind.</p></li>
			<li>Semantic html <p>Tables are for tabular data.</p></li>
			<li>Scalability <p>Just because your website works fine with one user logged in doesn't mean it won't choke when 1000 are logged in.</p></li>
			<li>Performance <p>Smart performance, in particular. There is no reason to optimize CSS selectors if all the images are huge.</p></li>
			<li>Favicons <p>Every website deserves a favicon!</p></li>

		<p>I have written a form module for Kohana to create form/label pair wrapped in a div. It is lightweight, easy to use, and makes creating forms much easier.</p>
